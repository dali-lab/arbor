### About ###
Arbor is a Unity plugin that renders creature models and phylogeny trees for feature comparison and analysis. Researchers are able to view 3d models of organism features online in the context of species' evolutionary position and other metrics. 

### Design ###

Users pass in a file describing the phylogeny tree and .obj files of the models. Arbor then parses the tree data and renders the models within a three dimensional tree structure, with the x y and z axes being different relational metrics. 

### System Requirements ###
Arbor requires the Unity plugin and any standard web browser to view.
